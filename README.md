# OverInsight

OverInsight: A Python tool for analyzing chat logs from popular messaging apps, tracking specified messages. 

## Description

OverInsight is a Python tool designed to analyze chat logs from various messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Telegram, and others*. It meticulously identifies specified valid messages, whether they're emojis, words, or sentences, and tallies their occurrences. Each message must precisely match a valid message to be counted. Users have the option to save parsed messages in CSV format, allowing for further analysis with other tools. Additionally, OverInsight provides insights into message frequency per user.

*Please note that, at present, OverInsight exclusively supports parsing WhatsApp logs.
